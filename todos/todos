change claude.md, so its not the main place for storing session notes
all the isntutitional algos. they need the same klabeling and visual indication of their bias, bullish bearish
we also want to incorporate them into the trading strategy somehow

trim the institutional algos, ensemble never agrees on anything , regardles of timeframe, even though the algos say they are bullish?

performance on SR A5 ENsemble

filtering on WHITE buy signals?? or should they fade after each? so that finally they disappear and thats the signal?

the algo MTF, how does the auto work? up or down from current tf?   

add indicator on HMA algos, when price has closed from outside the HMA BB bands and reenters and closes inside, thats a signal.
psosible color bars red from there, or purple
how to uss the bullish or bearish cross?


Super Algo
TODO: 

MIrrored Super Trend should be percentage (toggleable) based to account for log charts. Proper implementation in @mkn-hma-alt.pine (check HMA BB percentage based algorithm)
But I need you to push back on this if it is unsound, according to research.
